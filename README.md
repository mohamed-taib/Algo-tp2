# TP 2: Heap Sort and Max-Heap Construction

## Goal
This task focuses on implementing the **Heap Sort** algorithm and constructing a **Max-Heap** (TASmax) from a binary tree.

+ Mohamed Taib Benaicha 
+ Eddalia Hadjer


## Objectives
1. **Build a Max-Heap:** Transform an unsorted binary tree into a Max-Heap by ensuring the parent node's value is greater than its child nodes.
2. **Perform Heap Sort:** Use the Max-Heap property to sort an array in descending order.

## Tasks
1. Write an algorithm (`Construire-tas`) to construct a Max-Heap using a recursive "heapify" function (`Entasser`).
2. Implement Heap Sort by:
   - Extracting the root (maximum value).
   - Adjusting the heap structure after each extraction.

## Example
- **Input Array:** `[10, 22, 5, 18, 20, 25, 40, 30, 35, 12]`
- **Max-Heap:** `[40, 35, 25, 30, 20, 10, 5, 22, 18, 12]`
- **Sorted Output:** `[40, 35, 30, 25, 22, 20, 18, 12, 10, 5]`

## Deliverables
- Max-Heap Construction algorithm.
- Heap Sort algorithm with validation through examples.
